# Documentation
## Description
This is a docs for all my progress, ideas, and future features to add.

### [17.04.2025]
- added search books by title, author, and year published
- also added copies_available column to books table

##### to implement: 
- borrow books logic: a user can send a request to borrow books, then a librarian can issue the books to the user
- middlewares
- rbac (role-based access control)

### [20.04.2025]
- only librarians can add genre
- I want to implement "borrowing logic"

### [26.04.2025]
- I still haven't implemented the access control
- blockers: invalid tokens? invalid signature?
